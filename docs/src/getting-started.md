## Basics

As its name suggests, this library is a .NET implementation of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn). This document assumes you are already familiar with the fundamentals of GraphQL.

```

GraphQL sits between your database the "outside world." This library only concerns itself with this middle layer. For simplicity, the documentation uses hard-coded data, but in a real-world application your database layer would consist of some sort of ORM, like Entity Framework. And the only aspect of interactivity we will discuss here is how to actually execute the query. How specifically the query is received and the output returned is beyond the scope of this document. See the ["Further Reading"](#further-reading) section at the end of this document for examples and tutorials specific to various ORMs and deployment scenarios.

## Example

Here's a commented "Hello World" example.

GraphQL schema
```graphql
type StarWarsQuery {
  hero: Droid
}

type Droid {
  id: String!
  name: String
}
```

C# implementation
```csharp
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using GraphQL;
    using GraphQL.Http;
    using GraphQL.Types;

    /*
     * Database Layer
     * In this example, it's a simple object. In the "real world,"
     * it would likely be an object tied to an ORM, like Entity Framework.
     */
    public class Droid
    {
      public string Id { get; set; }
      public string Name { get; set; }
    }

    /*
     * Interface/Type Layer
     * Every type you wish to expose via GraphQL needs to be defined.
     * See the "Further Reading" section of the docs for ways of automatically generating schema.
     */
    public class DroidType : ObjectGraphType<Droid>
    {
      public DroidType()
      {
        Field(x => x.Id).Description("The Id of the Droid.");
        Field(x => x.Name, nullable: true).Description("The name of the Droid.");
      }
    }

    /*
     * Query/Mutation Layer
     * The root query is the entry point of your GraphQL service.
     * You must have one, and only one, root query object.
     * This object gathers together all your defined types and configures the types
     * of searches and filters you support.
     *
     * In this example, the data itself is hardcoded in the `resolve:` line.
     * In the "real world," you'd be querying your database.
     */
    public class StarWarsQuery : ObjectGraphType
    {
      public StarWarsQuery()
      {
        Field<DroidType>(
          "hero",
          resolve: context => new Droid { Id = "1", Name = "R2-D2" }
        );
      }
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
          Run().Wait();
        }

        /*
         * Interactivity Layer
         * First you generate the schema using your root query object.
         * Then you use `DocumentExecuter` to run the query against that schema.
         * How the query is received or the results returned is beyond the scope
         * of the library.
         */
        private static async Task Run()
        {
          Console.WriteLine("Hello GraphQL!");

          var schema = new Schema { Query = new StarWarsQuery() };

          var result = await new DocumentExecuter().ExecuteAsync( _ =>
          {
            _.Schema = schema;
            _.Query = @"
                query {
                  hero {
                    id
                    name
                  }
                }
              ";
          }).ConfigureAwait(false);

          var json = new DocumentWriter(indent: true).Write(result);

          Console.WriteLine(json);
        }
    }
}
```

Output
```
Hello GraphQL!
{
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Types & Interfaces

### Types

Types are the building blocks of your GraphQL service. Let's go back to our "Hello World" example:

```graphql
type Droid {
  id: String!
  name: String
}
```

```csharp
public class DroidType : ObjectGraphType<Droid>
{
  public DroidType()
  {
    Field(x => x.Id).Description("The Id of the Droid.");
    Field(x => x.Name, nullable: true).Description("The name of the Droid.");
  }
}
```

> TODO: Talk about the `Field` function and the various ways it can be used (e.g., `Field<Type>(...)`). Be sure to mention the default resolver.

> TODO: Be sure to introduce `ListGraphType`!

> TODO: Introduce `context.Source` and how that functions.

> TODO: Give some examples of more-complex fieldsâ€”for example, using `Field<Type>(...)` and `resolve:` to transform types or pull information from child objects.

### Interfaces

A GraphQL Interface is an abstract type that includes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface.

Here is an interface that represents a `Character` in the StarWars universe.

```graphql
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
}
```

```csharp
public class CharacterInterface : InterfaceGraphType<StarWarsCharacter>
{
  public CharacterInterface()
  {
    Name = "Character";
    Field(d => d.Id).Description("The id of the character.");
    Field(d => d.Name, nullable: true).Description("The name of the character.");
    Field<ListGraphType<CharacterInterface>>("friends");
  }
}
```

Any type that implements `Character` needs to have these exact fields, arguments, and return types.

```graphql
type Droid implements Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  primaryFunction: String
}
```

```csharp
public class DroidType : ObjectGraphType<Droid>
{
  public DroidType(IStarWarsData data)
  {
    Name = "Droid";
    Description = "A mechanical creature in the Star Wars universe.";

    Field(d => d.Id).Description("The id of the droid.");
    Field(d => d.Name, nullable: true).Description("The name of the droid.");

    Field<ListGraphType<CharacterInterface>>(
      "friends",
      resolve: context => data.GetFriends(context.Source)
    );
    Field(d => d.PrimaryFunction, nullable: true).Description("The primary function of the droid.");

    Interface<CharacterInterface>();
  }
}
```

#### Resolving Ambiguity

When you have a field that returns a GraphQL Interface, the engine needs to know which concrete graph type to use. So if you have a Character interface that is implemented by both Human and Droid types, the engine needs to know which graph type to choose. There are two ways of resolving this ambiguity: at the interface level or at the type level.

> TODO: Give some indication of the pros and cons of the various approaches. Are there performance implications, for example? Why choose one over the other?

> TODO: I'm also not clear why we're talking about this at all. If `ObjectGraphType<Type>` gives you a default `IsTypeOf`, why would anybody need to understand how this works? Are there situations where the default `IsTypeOf` doesn't work? If so, what are those situations? Can we just delete this whole "Resolving Ambiguity" section?

##### Interface Level (`ResolveType`)

`ResolveType` must be exhaustive. If you add another type that implements the interface, you must add it to the `ResolveType` code.

> If a type implements `ResolveType` then any `IsTypeOf` implementation is ignored.

```csharp
public class CharacterInterface : InterfaceGraphType<StarWarsCharacter>
{
  public CharacterInterface(
    //TODO: The following two lines need to be explained. What are these?
    DroidType droidType,
    HumanType humanType)
  {
    Name = "Character";

    ...

    ResolveType = obj =>
    {
        if (obj is Droid)
        {
            return droidType;
        }

        if (obj is Human)
        {
            return humanType;
        }

        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException($"Could not resolve graph type for {obj.GetType().Name}");
    };
  }
}
```

##### Type Level (`IsTypeOf`)

The data object being mapped is passed to the `IsTypeOf` function which should return a boolean value.

```csharp
//TODO: Isn't the following line missing the <Type> after ObjectGraphType?
public class DroidType : ObjectGraphType
{
  public DroidType(IStarWarsData data)
  {
    Name = "Droid";

    ...

    Interface<CharacterInterface>();

    IsTypeOf = obj => obj is Droid;
  }
}
```

> `ObjectGraphType<T>` provides a default implementation of IsTypeOf for you.


### Unions

Unions are a composition of two different types.

```csharp
public class CatOrDog : UnionGraphType
{
  public CatOrDog()
  {
    Type<Cat>();
    Type<Dog>();
  }
}
```

## Queries & Mutations

### Arguments

Before we get into the queries and mutations themselves, you need to understand how arguments can be passed. 

In GraphQL, you can provide arguments to a field as follows:

```graphql
query {
  droid(id: "1") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

You can use `GetArgument` on `ResolveFieldContext` to retrieve argument values.  `GetArgument` will attempt to coerce the argument values to the generic type it is given, including primitive values, objects, and enumerations.  You can gain access to the value directly through the `Arguments` dictionary on `ResolveFieldContext`.


```csharp
public class StarWarsQuery : ObjectGraphType
{
  public StarWarsQuery(IStarWarsData data)
  {
    Field<DroidType>(
      "droid",
      arguments: new QueryArguments(new QueryArgument<StringGraphType> { Name = "id" }),
      resolve: context =>
      {
        var id = context.GetArgument<string>("id");
        //TODO: What is the following line doing here? Is it an alternative? Or what?
        var objectId = context.Arguments["id"];
        return data.GetDroidByIdAsync(id);
      }
    );
  }
}
```

> TODO: We need to introduce optional (nullable) arguments.

### Queries

The query is your service's primary entry point. You must have one, and only one, root Query object that is an `ObjectGraphType`.  Queries must only fetch data and never modify it.

```graphql
query {
  hero {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```csharp
public class StarWarsQuery : ObjectGraphType
{
  public StarWarsQuery()
  {
    Field<DroidType>(
      "hero",
      resolve: context => new Droid { Id = "1", Name = "R2-D2" }
    );
  }
}
```

> TODO: Needs to be expanded to demonstrate basics like how to search and return multiple results. That's going to include adding an explanation of passing a database context to the constructor.

### Mutations

To perform a mutation you need to have a root Mutation object that is an `ObjectGraphType`.  Mutations make modifications to data and return a result.  You can only have a single root Mutation object.

* See the [StarWars example](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/tree/master/src/GraphQL.StarWars) for more details.
* See the [official GraphQL documentation on mutations](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

```csharp
//TODO: Doesn't really belong here. This belongs in the Execution section. Focus on the mutation-specific code.
public class StarWarsSchema : Schema
{
    public StarWarsSchema(Func<Type, GraphType> resolveType)
        : base(resolveType)
    {
        Query = (StarWarsQuery)resolveType(typeof (StarWarsQuery));
        Mutation = (StarWarsMutation)resolveType(typeof (StarWarsMutation));
    }
}

/// <example>
/// This is an example JSON request for a mutation
/// {
///   "query": "mutation ($human:HumanInput!){ createHuman(human: $human) { id name } }",
///   "variables": {
///     "human": {
///       "name": "Boba Fett"
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// </example>
public class StarWarsMutation : ObjectGraphType<object>
{
    public StarWarsMutation(StarWarsData data)
    {
        Field<HumanType>(
            "createHuman",
            arguments: new QueryArguments(
                new QueryArgument<NonNullGraphType<HumanInputType>> {Name = "human"}
            ),
            resolve: context =>
            {
                var human = context.GetArgument<Human>("human");
                return data.AddHuman(human);
            });
    }
}

public class HumanInputType : InputObjectGraphType
{
    public HumanInputType()
    {
        Name = "HumanInput";
        Field<NonNullGraphType<StringGraphType>>("name");
        Field<StringGraphType>("homePlanet");
    }
}

// in-memory data store
public class StarWarsData
{
    ...

    public Human AddHuman(Human human)
    {
        human.Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        _humans.Add(human);
        return human;
    }
}
```

> TODO: And how are errors handled? What if something happens during the `AddHuman` part in the database layer? Will a meaningful error message be returned?

### Subscriptions

The Schema class supports a Subscription graph type and the parser supports the `subscription` keyword.  Subscriptions are an experimental feature of the GraphQL specification.

```graphql
subscription comments($repoName: String!) {
  newComments(repoName: $repoName) {
    content
    postedBy {
      username
    }
    postedAt
  }
}
```

## Execution

### Schema Generation

> TODO: Needs to be expanded. So far we've seen two types of schema creation: a full-blown class inheriting `Schema` and the simple `new Schema { Query = new QueryObj(dataObj) }`. How do these work? What are the differences? How do mutations fit in? Is the only way to include both a query and a mutation the way you show in the mutation example?

#### RegisterType
When the Schema is built, it looks at the "root" types (Query, Mutation, Subscription) and gathers all of the GraphTypes they expose. Often when you are working with an interface type the concrete types are not exposed on the root types (or any of their children). Since those concrete types are never exposed in the type graph the Schema doesn't know they exist. This is what the `RegisterType<>` method on the Schema is for.  By using `RegisterType<>`, it tells the Schema about the specific type and it will properly add it to the `PossibleTypes` collection on the interface type when the Schema is initialized.

```csharp
public class StarWarsSchema : Schema
{
  public StarWarsSchema()
  {
    Query = new StarWarsQuery();
    RegisterType<DroidType>();
  }
}
```

### `DocumentExecuter`

> TODO: Needs expanding. What are the various inputs? Does it *have* to be asynchronous? How does it handle errors? What level of granularity can one expect in the error messages?

#### Variables

You can pass variables received from the client to the execution engine by using the `Inputs` property.

* See the [official GraphQL documentation on variables](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables)

Here is what a query looks like with a variable:

```graphql
query DroidQuery($droidId: String!) {
  droid(id: $droidId) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Here is what this query would look like as a JSON request:

```json
{
 "query": "query DroidQuery($droidId: String!) { droid(id: $droidId) { id name } }",
 "variables": {
   "droidId": "1"
 }
}
```

```csharp
var variablesJson = // get from request
// `ToInputs` converts the json to the `Inputs` class
var inputs = variablesJson.ToInputs();

var result = await executer.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
    _.Inputs = inputs;
});
```

### Input Validation

There [are a number of query validation rules](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Validation) that are ran when a query is executed.  All of these are turned on by default.  You can add your own validation rules or clear out the existing ones by accessing the `ValidationRules` property.

```csharp
var result = await executer.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
    _.ValidationRules = new[] {new RequiresAuthValidationRule()}.Concat(DocumentValidator.CoreRules());
});
```
